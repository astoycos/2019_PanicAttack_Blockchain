1. Download GO
	-https://golang.org/dl/

2. Download IPFS 
	- https://docs.ipfs.io/introduction/install/

3. Download LibP2P
	- Setup
	The best way to get your code environment set up is to clone this entire library and write your code within it. You can develop outside the environment they provide but it requires knowing how to work with gx. We’ll show you the easy way. Assuming you already have Go installed:

	go get -d github.com/libp2p/go-libp2p/...
	navigate to the cloned directory from above
	make
	make deps
	This gets you all the packages and dependencies you need from this repo through the gx package manager. Again, we don’t like gx as it breaks a lot of Go convention (besides, why not just stick with go get?) but it’s worth the inconvenience to use this otherwise nice library.

	We’re going to develop inside the examples subdirectory. So let’s create a directory under examples called p2p with

	mkdir ./examples/p2p
	Then navigate to your new p2p folder and create a main.go file. We will be writing all our code in this file.

3. IPFS Init 

4. IPFS daemon
	- Starts IPFS Node 

5. Start P2P network with terminal command 
	- go run main.go -l 10000 -secio
